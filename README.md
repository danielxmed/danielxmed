# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel 

**Doctor by vocation, coder by passion, and an incurable nerd by sheer genetic luck.**

---

## ðŸ©º Who am I anyway?

Ever met a doctor who believes code cures as effectively as medicine? Well, nice to meet you, I'm exactly that rare species. Founder of **Nobrega Medtech**, I'm converting coffee and sleepless nights into intelligent health solutions powered by AI while doing advanced backend in Python, C#, SwiftUI, and Node.js. Yes, I know, "Python for backend? How groundbreaking!" ðŸ™„

---

## ðŸ§  My superpowers (a.k.a favorite technologies):

- **Machine Learning & NLP:** making algorithms learn medicine faster than most medical students.
- **Python:** my daily coffee, my bread and butter, my everything.
- **C# & SwiftUI:** because I can't survive on snakes (Python) alone; sometimes I need to be a bit sharper and swifter.
- **Node.js:** because someone here has to be fast, considering my physical speed is zero.

---

## ðŸ¤– Amazing projects (modestly speaking):

- **[Nobra](#)** - A smart chatbot for clinical support and automated scientific production. Imagine Dr. House meets Jarvis.
- Several other "top secret" projects (just kidding, I'm too lazy to document them).

---

## ðŸŽ¹ When I'm not coding or saving lives:

- I play piano to pretend I have hobbies other than programming.
- I watch movies and TV series to maintain my endless repertoire of nerdy references.
- I talk about neurology, AI, and tech until someone begs for mercy.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:

- Email me at [daniel@nobregamedtech.com.br](mailto:daniel@nobregamedtech.com.br) if you're brave enough to talk about medicine, technology, or Star Wars.
- Find me on GitHub (obviously).

And remember:

> "Life's too short to document code... so I built an AI to do it for me."
